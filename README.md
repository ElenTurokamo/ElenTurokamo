## Hi there! ðŸŒ˜
I'm [Elen](https://www.instagram.com/_lovelycoffee_/), a solo developer from Kazakhstan.
It's very fun to learn new, try not ordinary solutions and just write working code.
Currently I'm working on my first ever game with code name [Silent Library](https://github.com/ElenTurokamo/Silent-Library). It's about farming, adventures, secrets and more. I'm also learning how to draw sprites, how to use unity, learning C# and trying my best.

### Fun facts:
- I love photography and I can see beauty in EVERYTHING.
- Omniscent Reader - is the my favourite book.
