Hi there 👋

I'm Elen, a programmer and solo developer from Kazakhstan.

I focus on building things that actually work and scale, not just prototypes for show. I care about understanding systems end-to-end: architecture, data flow, edge cases, and what will break later if it’s done poorly now. Refactoring and rethinking solutions is part of my normal workflow, not a failure.

Right now I’m actively working on [Deus Weather Bot](https://github.com/ElenTurokamo/Deus-Weather) —
a weather bot with a clean backend, database-driven logic, and a strong focus on structure, reliability, and future extensibility. It’s not just “get data and print it”, but a project where I deliberately practice proper architecture and long-term maintainability.

I constantly learn by building, breaking, fixing, and rebuilding systems until they make sense.
If something feels fragile or unclear — I won’t leave it that way.
